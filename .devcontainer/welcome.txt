👋 Welcome to the project! Here are some useful commands you can run:

🔧 `make test-all` - starts necessary Docker services and runs all tests.
🔧 `make -k test-all docker-compose-down` - the same as above, but tears down the Docker services after running all the tests.
🔧 `make fmt` - runs formatter, this command requires the nightly toolchain to be installed by running `rustup toolchain install nightly`.
🔧 `make fix` - runs formatter and clippy checks.
🔧 `make typos` - runs the spellcheck tool over the codebase. (Install by running `cargo install typos`)
🔧 `make build-docs` - builds docs.
🔧 `make docker-compose-up` - starts Docker services.
🔧 `make docker-compose-down` - stops Docker services.
🔧 `make docker-compose-logs` - shows Docker logs.

Happy coding 🧑🏻‍💻!
