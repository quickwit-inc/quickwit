Quickwit is a distributed search engine built from the ground up to achieve high performance, high reliability while keeping its architecture simple and manageable for the mere mortals.

Quickwit is written in Rust and built on top of the powerful [tantivy](https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy) library and is meant to work on big datasets.


## Why Quickwit?
Quickwit is born from the idea that today's search engines are hard to manage and too costly on specific use cases like analytics in a multitenancy environment or low QPS use cases.

How can this dream comes true? By searching data straight from object storage like AWS S3, achieving true decoupled compute and storage. Not only is Quickwit more cost-efficient, but search clusters are also easier to operate. One can add or remove search instances in seconds. Multi-tenant search becomes trivial.
