<DocCardList />

It is possible to ingest data with log shippers like [OpenTelemetry](../log-management/overview.md), [Fluentbit](../../quickwit/fluentbit-logs.yaml), or [Vector](../../quickwit/vector-otel-logs.yaml). It's also possible to send traces from your apps to the [OpenTelemetry Collector](../../quickwit/otel-collector-traces.yaml) and then to Quickwit.
